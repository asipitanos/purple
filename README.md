# Weather app Interview tech test

The app was built on Android studio 2025.2.1 Patch 1 with gradle 8.13

To run:
1. clone repo
2. open it as project with Android studio
3. sync gradle
4. run app configuration on an emulator or physical device.


The project handles if the user does not give correct permissions at install state and when the internet is dropped/reusmed. 

It also caches last data and will load them when the app opens before updating the data with the new.
